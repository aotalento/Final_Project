# Final_Project

Aim of our project:
To use machine learning to predict how often an employee will miss work.The algorithm is trained based on information gathered from the employee at the time of employment as well as other features.
Information includes: Reason for absence, Social smoker/drinker, Pet, Distance from Residence to Work, Age, Education, Children.

Obtained data from: University of California Irving https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+workThe data set was originally used in academic research at the Universidade Nove de Julho - Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management.

Analysis:
We  created a database using Postgres, queried the data using Tableau and created a visualization dashboardWe imported the data into jupyter notebook to apply our machine learning algorithms

Libraries include:pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, imblearn, and. we then use pandas read_csv() to read the data
